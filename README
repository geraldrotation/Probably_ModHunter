Features:
-Single Target / AoE (Multi-Shot with hotkey support for barrage)
-Engineering gloves usage is part of the rotation
-Stampede, AMoC, Lynx Rush, and Rabid are only cast when cooldowns is enabled
-Fervor is only cast when focus is below 50 instead of on cooldown
-Toggle button for automatic aspect switching while moving, standing still, or in combat
-Automatic tranq shot when the enemy is enraged/dispellable and not a charmed player
-Automatic Master's Call when the player is rooted
-Multitarget mode will only engage AOE abilities when both the multitarget toggle is set and there are at least 3 active enemies - this means that you can generally leave multitarget toggled on and not worry about only casting multi-shot all the time
-Pause rotation when in feign death
-Delayed interrupting: Don't attempt to interrupt until the spellcast is 50% complete
-Toggle to allow for automatic serpent sting on your current mouseover target whenever that target doesn't already have the serpent sting DOT/debuff.  This is a great way to 'DOT-up' multiple enemies that are spread around
-Support for international clients
-Revive Pet, Heart of the Phoenix, & Call Pet should work correctly 100% of the time
-When out of combat will automatically cast Hunter's mark on your target if it's been targetted at least 2 seconds
-Will not cast Serpent Sting or Black Arrow against a charmed player in order to prevent DOTS from killing them


Hotkeys:
-Left Shift - Pause
-Left Control - Binding Shot
-Left Alt - Explosive Trap
-Left Alt - Snake Trap
-Left Alt - Ice Trap

Survival:
-Exhilaration when health below 50%
-Healthstone when below 40% health
-Master Healing Potion when below 40% health -- This is still broken when the potion is on a cooldown or shared cooldown
-Deterrence as a last resort when you are < 10% health
-Automatic misdirect to focus or pet when you pull too much threat

Main Rotation:
-Basically following the Icy Veins suggested priority systema
-Controlled single-target tests have shown this profile to perform about 1.5% better than simcraft

To Do:
-Figure out how to share common blocks of code between the specializations so as to not duplicate code
-Implement G52 Landshark usage as part of cooldowns
-Figure out how to get Healing Potions & Virmen's Bite potions to work 100% when potions are already on cooldowna
-More DPS fine-tuning
