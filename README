To Do:
Figure out how to share common blocks of code between the specializations so as to not duplicate code
Implement G52 Landshark usage as part of cooldowns
Figure out how to get Healing Potions & Virmen's Bite potions to work 100% when potions are already on cooldown
More cleanup and optimization and other fancy tricks
